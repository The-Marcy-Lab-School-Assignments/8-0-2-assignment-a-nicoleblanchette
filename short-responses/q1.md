# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Making API requests that have keys in the frontend is dangerous because the key is exposed in the netwrok requests. Bad actors can use the key make large amounts of requests that'll cost money for the owner of the key. Making requests to the server avoids this danger because the client-side application never uses the API key, so bad actors cannot (easily?) access it.
